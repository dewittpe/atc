# atc
Scrapper to download all ATC data from [WHOCC](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/)

This is not the only code to do this work.  The noteable difference between the code provided here and other code examples is that this as been written in "off-the-shelf" R.  No additional packages are requried.  If you have R installed you should be able to run the script with no additional installs.

The code will download the ATC data and write a .csv which can then be imported into to other projects as needed.
